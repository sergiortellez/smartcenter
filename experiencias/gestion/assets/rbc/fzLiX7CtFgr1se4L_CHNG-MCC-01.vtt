<v ->Disgraced executives, dramatic weather rescues</v>

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.670
and massive data breaches have one thing in common.

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.050
They describe crises that force businesses

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.960
to take fast action.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.860
And at the heart of any crisis,

6
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.230
a leader must navigate unexpected changes

7
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.080
to keep their team, employees and companies

8
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.233
safe as possible.

9
00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:26.780
A crisis is an unexpected event that could potentially

10
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.373
harm a business and its employees, customers, and vendors.

11
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.470
Leading through a crisis requires fast action and change.

12
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.820
Often, those changes have long lasting

13
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.480
business implications.

14
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.420
The COVID 19 pandemic is a prime example

15
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.110
of an unexpected disruption

16
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.560
that resulted in permanent changes.

17
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.670
Companies had to adopt new business models overnight

18
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.283
and many of these changes remain in place today.

19
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.770
All change creates stress and requires strong leadership

20
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.760
to rise above it yet a crisis calls

21
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.660
for a slightly different approach.

22
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.730
These tips can help.

23
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.400
First, prioritize communication.

24
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.410
Get from reliable sources and share it

25
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.270
as soon as possible with frequent updates.

26
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.550
Next, model positivity, stay grounded and calm

27
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.450
to help others see the light at the end of the tunnel.

28
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.930
Third, lead with confidence.

29
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.500
Take swift action and bounce back quickly

30
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.823
when the water gets rough.

31
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.130
Expect tough spot and discouraged employees.

32
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.070
It's your job to recognize struggles

33
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.190
but maintain perspective.

34
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.650
Doing so makes it easier

35
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.623
for your team to keep moving forward.

36
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.290
The next tip is to trust your people.

37
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.070
Lean on departmental experts and give them autonomy

38
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.910
to make decisions and keep things moving.

39
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.460
Fifth, toggle between here and now

40
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.400
and big picture thinking.

41
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.040
As you take action today,

42
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.670
be sure to consider future impacts,

43
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.800
Next, get in the trenches.

44
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.530
Don't lead from a boardroom.

45
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.010
Be accessible, working alongside

46
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.423
and in support of your team.

47
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.560
Finally, when the worst has passed,

48
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.590
look for the lessons learned.

49
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.800
A post-crisis analysis helps determine changes

50
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.913
and preventative measures moving forward.

51
00:02:14.877 --> 00:02:17.580
Whether it's a crisis ripped from the headlines

52
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.170
or a minor disruption,

53
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.240
when change suddenly occurs, it's tough.

54
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.600
Leading with humanity, positivity

55
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.920
and transparency will help the company and your team

56
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.430
weather the storm.

57
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.960
Connecting to a common goal and working together

58
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.010
will see you through.
